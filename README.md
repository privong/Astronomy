Astronomy
=========

This contains various astronomy scripts I've written for my data analysis and processing. Some of them may be more widely useful. However, I provide no guarantee that they will even run, much less provide useable results.

If you use these scripts or derivates of them in publications, I would appreciate a mention in the acknowledgements as well as a (digital) copy of the paper.

Directories
-----------

* Archives/		- Pulling data from online archives
*DataAnalysis/		- assist with processing/analysis of reduced data
*DataReduction/		- data reduction scripts (often, pipelines)
*General/		- general use files, other scripts may depend on files in here
*Observing/		- scripts related to observations *Papers/			- Paper writing and bibliography tools.
*SimulationTools/	- Scripts related to analyzing outputs of simulations currently this includes the zeno nbody/sph code.
*Talks/			- Tools to assist with managing talks written in LaTeX/ beamer.

Dependencies
------------

Most of the scripts depend on common python libraries (numpy, scipy) and sometimes, the astropy library. These can all be installed via pip.
