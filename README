This contains various astronomy scripts I've written for my data analysis and processing. Some of them may be more widely useful. However, I provide no guarantee that they will even run, much less provide useable results.

If you use these scripts or derivates of them in publications, I would appreciate a mention in the acknowledgements as well as a (digital) copy of the paper.

Directories:

DataAnalysis/		- assist with processing/analysis of reduced data
DataReduction/		- data reduction scripts (often, pipelines)
General/		- general use files, other scripts may depend on files 
			  in here
Observing/		- scripts related to observations
SimulationTools/	- Scripts related to analyzing outputs of simulations
			  currently this includes the zeno nbody/sph code.

Dependencies:

Most of the scripts depend on standard python libraries (numpy, scipy) and sometimes, the astropy library. These can all be installed via pip.
