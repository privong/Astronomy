This contains various astronomy scripts I've written for my data analysis and processing. Some of them may be more widely useful. However, I provide no guarantee that they will even run, much less provide useable results.

Directories:

Observing/		- scripts related to observations
DataReduction/		- data reduction scripts (often, pipelines)
DataAnalysis/		- assist with processing/analysis of reduced data
