To make the test particle simulations, you'll need to run something like
the following commands:

$ make -f InitialData jhat12X.dat

This creates the file with the information on the initial angular
momentum for all the test particles. It is used to tell Identikit which
particles to display. This jhat file is valid for the simulations
beginning with "r12".

Now to make a simulation, run:

$ mkdir r124; make -f InitialData r124/i124.dat

This will create a zeno initial conditions snapshot for an equal mass,
eccentricity=1 pass where the pericenter approach is 4/16 length units.
To run the simulation and create the test particle simulation, add the
following text to another makefile (which I call "Run"):

> run124:
>   treecode in=r124/i124.dat out=r124/r124_%04x.dat \
>       save=r124/r124.state%01d dtime=1/256 eps=0.0075 \
>       usequad=t tstop=10 dtout=1/16

You can then evolve the system by running the following command:

$ make -f Run run124

To do this for other pericenter approach distances, re-run the above,
substituting other codes. The rXYZ code corresponds to:
X - orbital eccentricity (always 1 for the provided sims)
Y - for mass ratio of a:b, Y=a+b. For equal mass encounters, Y=2
Z - pericentric separation in 16ths of a length unit. Z=3 has a
pericentric separation of 3/16 length units.

Once you've done that for as many models as you feel is necessary, you
can run Identikit using something like the following:

$ idkit jhat=jhat12X.dat sims=r124/r124_%04x.dat,r125/r125_%04x.dat

This will load Identikit and give the program access to the simulations
with equal-mass encounters and pericentric separations of 4/16 and 5/16
length units.

To explore the parameter space, use the three mouse buttons (you'll need
a 3-button mouse) and keyboard commands (press '?' inside Identikit to
see the commands).

By default, identikit loads such that the left mouse button controls the
viewing angles, and the other two mouse buttons control the orientations
of disk 1 and 2. Spacebar (backspace) moves forwards (backwards) in time.
'n' ('p') move ahead (behind) in the comma delineated list of 
simulations provided when Identikit was invoked. Other keys modify the 
mouse behavior to allow you to explore other regions of parameter space 
(see '?' above). The values for some parameters are shown in the lower-
right panel.

I would recommend playing around with the interface a bit before trying
to load in data cube projections. That way you can start to get a feel
for how changing the parameters in real-time

Regarding the data cube, you'll want to create a sky-plane (XY) and two
position velocity (XV and VY) images by projecting the data cubes along
the appropriate axes. It's a bit up to you how you want to do that, but
there are some important details on the ppm images to give to identikit:
- they must have the same pixel dimensions
- the spatial axes in all projections must be the same size (i.e., they
must be the same number of arcsec on a side)
These images can be passed to Identikit via the xyimage, xvimage,
and vyimage arguments. These will then be displayed in the appropriate
panels. Not the images must be in ppm format.

The direction of increasing velocity is important. In the XV panel
(lower-left), velocity should increase towards the top and in the VY
panel (upper-right) velocity should increase towards the right.

Good luck!
